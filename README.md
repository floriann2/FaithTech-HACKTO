# FaithTech-HACKTO

## Inspiration
This is where faith meets ation action. Hackathons are an exciting, short-term community environment, 
where we can tackle challenges and find solutions using technology to move the mission of Jesus forward. 

## What It Does
Passenger Collection App and Database Tool for Mission Aviation Fellowship. 

## How I Built It
Using a combination of HMTL, CSS, JS, and BootStrap, we are continuosly developing the app for functional use by MAF and their affiliates.

## What I Learned
Not all data is meant to be captured; exlusivity and privacy rights are to be taken very seriously. 

## What is Next
Continuous iteration on application & database using React and SQL tools. Test Trial preparation underway.
